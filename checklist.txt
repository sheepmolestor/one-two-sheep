Spriting (high priority): - Sprites that are made and pushed to the repository should probably be reported on in the discord channel
	- Player sprites
	- Enemy sprites
		- Standing enemies
		- Walking enemies
		- Jumping enemies
		- Shooting enemies
		- Floating enemies
		- Any reasonable combination of those that makes sense to exist as an enemy (eg, a monster who stands still
		  and shoots projectiles at you, different actions for the same enemy can be made as separate sprites)
	- Tile sprites (MUST be done in Backgrounds folder)
		- Sprites done for planned out environments
	- Bullet sprites
	- Particle/explosion sprites
	- Prop sprites
	- NPC sprites
	- Background (start with 1024x768, repeating horizontally)
		- Potentially, we could have the whole background made for each room, so the background sizes will vary as
		  long as they can fit the screen.
	- Platforming sprites:
		- Ladder
		- Switch
		- Lock
		- Door
	- Animation of certain sprites (will be followed up on after done)
Sounds (low priority): - also should be reported on discord channel
	- Platforming sound effects
	- Level music (there's going to be potentially a lot for this)
	- Game over music
	- Enemy sound effects
	- Shooting sound effects
	- Explosion sound effects
	- Title music
	- Pause screen music
	- Dialogue sound effects
	- Natural sound effects (eg lightning in background)
	- General sound effects (eg pressing a button in pause menu)
Level design/Ideas to be tested (high priority): - maybe use branches for certain mechanics
	- Inventory
		- Weapons
		- Equipment
		- Consumables
		- Quest items
	- Quests
	- Enemies
		- Unique attacks
	- Teleporters
	- Chests
	- Keys, locks
	- Switches, doors
	- Level select OR main area (depends on style/theme of game)
	- Combat system
		- Different attacks (eg holding shoot shoots bigger, more powerful bullets)
		- Shoot with mouse??? (yeah probably a good idea aye FailFish)
	- Powerups
	- Coins/currency
	- Upgrades
	- Experience/level system
	- Attributes (attack, defence, agility, dexterity, health, etc.)
	- Save system
	- NPCs
	- Dialogue
	- Cutscenes
	- Platforming features (ie ladders, boxes, swinging vines)
	- Proper jumping physics
	- Platforming mechanics (eg dashing, sliding, ducking, crawling, climbing, flying, wall-jumping, ledges)
Game design (very high priority):
	- SOMEONE FORMAT THIS UGLY LOOKING ASS CHECKLIST ON GOOGLE DOCS OR NOTEPAD++ OR SOMETHING and maybe transfer it to a different cloud thing like dropbox for
	  easier access
	- Consider the intended audience
	- Theme (VERY IMPORTANT!!!)
	- Story
	- Setting (planning the visual design)
	- Style (eg open-world, etc.)
		- Decide on the balance on the sub-genres (so like, how much is just straight-forward stuff and how much is open)
	- Map design/planning of arrangement of levels
		- Consider the intended time length of every area and how slow progress should be made
		- Plan out any backtracking (eg need to collect an important item to unlock an ability, then go back)
		- Sidequests/bonus rooms
		- Important to mark out 'safe areas'
		- Plan of intended route throughout game (not required if linear gameplay)
	- Art type (eg minimal, 8-bit, etc.)
	- Sound type
	- Type of gameplay (combat or platforming oriented, or something else?)
		- Puzzles?????
		- Exploration?????
		- "you gotta get all 5 of these things before you can get past, m8"
	- Level structure (ie planning what individual levels will look like, eg going upwards or rightwards in a certain level)
	- Difficulty curve (pretty darn important)
		- Choosing a difficulty at the start of the game??? (should we do that)
	- Replayability - when going back to a level, will everything be restarted, or will switches be deactivated,
	  enemies be revived, etc.
	- Simplicity - we need to decide on how simple we're going to make this game, or how complex.
	- Pace - should it be full of action and combat, or slow and steady
	- Coming up with new ideas, because we need to keep it interesting after a while, or making it engaging through
	  the story, for example. (this is what im trying to do right now unsurprisingly)
		- New gameplay mechanics, maybe?
